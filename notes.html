      <h1>ART JOB TITLES / PATHS</h1>
      <p>Just jotting down some notes about some job titles and career paths for an aspiring artist</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row2">
      <h2>Concept Artist</h2>
      <p>Concept art is art in it's purest form. You have total creative freedom and expression. You are free to experiment and create, withing the scope at least, and probably have the most creative freedom in the industry outside of pure art.</p>
      <p>Concept artist, however, are subject to the quantity over quality mentalty. In the industry, you often have a set number of concepts that you must complete each day. You do not get the luxury of producing amazing cover art or illustrations that you see online and in showcase reels. The concept artist is very much as it sounds, spamming out concepts as fast as possible to see what sticks, and then passing those concepts onward to be fully developed by the team.</p>
      <p>There are many many types of concept artist and I will list a few below, but remember that concept art is the basis for all art in the industry and it is therefore practically impossible to list every type.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Environmental</h3>
      <p>An environmental concept artist creates the concept art for the open world. Some exaples being landscapes, cities, forests, etc. There are a wide variety of scenes you can create as an environmental concept artist and have a lot of freedom and creativity here.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Architectual</h3>
      <p>Architectual concept artist are found mainly in the architectual industry, both full time and contract, and often work closely with clients. The job of a architectual concept artist is to clearly convey the clients ideas or to sell a client on a certain look. It is one of the most important aspects of the architecture industry, as getting this initial step wrong becomes increasingly costly to fix. There is some overlap with environmental concept artist here, however, architectual concepting and visualization is generally more restrictive.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-col">
        <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
      </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Character</h3>
      <p>Character concept artist create the iconic characters found in all types of media, from heroic main characters to dasterdly villans. Extreme knowledge of shape and form come into play here, especially for humanoid characters. Replicating the human form could be considered one of the harder areas of concept art, however, as a concept artist you will most likely be more focused on the feel and emotion of the character in your concepts rather than making it look perfect.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Fashion & Costume Design</h3>
      <p>Fashion and costume design shares a lot of overlap with character art, and could even be considered a necessary skill for a character artist, however, this is a sub-specialy that could arise in very large companies or more commonly in the fashion industry itself. This type of specialty also pops up in 3D and I will mention it there as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">

  <!--Storyboard Artist-->
  <section class="notes-body">
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>Storyboard Artist</h2>
      <p>They do storyboard stuff. Kind of like concept art, but for the flow of the story / scene creation, etc. Less focus on art, a lot of focus on story telling.</p>
      <p>Absolute creative freedom. You are the game/movie/film, the mastermind</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
<!-- Animation -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>Animation</h2>
      <p>Work closely with many artists to bring their creations to life. 3D animation is becoming more and more automated, even now you can take a model into a free website and have it rigged and animated in seconds. Really got to be the best of the best to get into animation.</p>
      <p>That being said it is super fun and expressive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>2D Art</h2>
      <p>2D art, including concept art I guess, but I am too lazy to make all these into a separate category, so I just lump em all together.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Comic Artist</h3>
      <p>Basically a storyboard artist and a illistrator in one, and without the team, you are the whole team. Just kidding, I guess in big comic company (do those exist?) you would either do the storyboarding or clean up the storyboard and make it into the comic/illistrated finished version.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Sketching</h3>
      <p>This is a category on art station. I dunno if you could speciallize into sketching or whatever but here it is. Probably the unprofessional version of a concept artist</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Pixel Art</h3>
      <p>Super cool 2D art used for 2D flash games, indie games, etc. I have no idea how they get so much detail and personalization out of like one one-millionth of the pixels that the rest of artist use, but power to them. General title for 2d pixel artists, im sure they also subspecialize into environment and character art as well.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Anime & Manga</h3>
      <p>Similar to comic artists but with a different art style. Used mainly in tv shows, cartoons, and anime comics ie manga. 2D artwork with a very specific style.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Illustration</h3>
      <p>Basically the sexy 2D artist. Unlike the concept artist or storyboard artist who focus on the concept of the piece, the illustrators job is to take the final concept and make it look amazing. These are the book covers, highlight reels, and generally any 2D work you see on art station and the like. As it is the final artwork, the job titles vary quite a bit depending on the industry but ill list a few here; Book Illustrations, Game Art/Cover Art, board and card game art, children's art, editorial illustration, scientific illustration & visualization, and basically any "Concept Art" that is released by companies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>Architectual Visualization</h2>
      <p>Mainly a 3D process of turning designs from other concept artists or architects into a 3D viewable scene where clients can get an idea of how the structure will look. Pretty popular and in demand, although not a lot of creative freedom, or dragons, a severe lack of dragons to be honest.</p>

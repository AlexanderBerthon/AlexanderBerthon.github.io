      <h1>ART JOB TITLES / PATHS</h1>
      <p>Just jotting down some notes about some job titles and career paths for an aspiring artist</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="row2">
      <h2>Concept Artist</h2>
      <p>Concept art is art in it's purest form. You have total creative freedom and expression. You are free to experiment and create, withing the scope at least, and probably have the most creative freedom in the industry outside of pure art.</p>
      <p>Concept artist, however, are subject to the quantity over quality mentalty. In the industry, you often have a set number of concepts that you must complete each day. You do not get the luxury of producing amazing cover art or illustrations that you see online and in showcase reels. The concept artist is very much as it sounds, spamming out concepts as fast as possible to see what sticks, and then passing those concepts onward to be fully developed by the team.</p>
      <p>There are many many types of concept artist and I will list a few below, but remember that concept art is the basis for all art in the industry and it is therefore practically impossible to list every type.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Environmental</h3>
      <p>An environmental concept artist creates the concept art for the open world. Some exaples being landscapes, cities, forests, etc. There are a wide variety of scenes you can create as an environmental concept artist and have a lot of freedom and creativity here.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Architectual</h3>
      <p>Architectual concept artist are found mainly in the architectual industry, both full time and contract, and often work closely with clients. The job of a architectual concept artist is to clearly convey the clients ideas or to sell a client on a certain look. It is one of the most important aspects of the architecture industry, as getting this initial step wrong becomes increasingly costly to fix. There is some overlap with environmental concept artist here, however, architectual concepting and visualization is generally more restrictive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Character</h3>
      <p>Character concept artist create the iconic characters found in all types of media, from heroic main characters to dasterdly villans. Extreme knowledge of shape and form come into play here, especially for humanoid characters. Replicating the human form could be considered one of the harder areas of concept art, however, as a concept artist you will most likely be more focused on the feel and emotion of the character in your concepts rather than making it look perfect.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Fashion & Costume Design</h3>
      <p>Fashion and costume design shares a lot of overlap with character art, and could even be considered a necessary skill for a character artist, however, this is a sub-specialy that could arise in very large companies or more commonly in the fashion industry itself. This type of specialty also pops up in 3D and I will mention it there as well.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>Storyboard Artist</h2>
      <p>They do storyboard stuff. Kind of like concept art, but for the flow of the story / scene creation, etc. Less focus on art, a lot of focus on story telling.</p>
      <p>Absolute creative freedom. You are the game/movie/film, the mastermind</p>
    </div>
  <div class="about-col2">

<!-- Animation -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>Animation</h2>
      <p>Work closely with many artists to bring their creations to life. 3D animation is becoming more and more automated, even now you can take a model into a free website and have it rigged and animated in seconds. Really got to be the best of the best to get into animation.</p>
      <p>That being said it is super fun and expressive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col2">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Rigging -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="about-col">
        <h2>Rigging</h2>
        <p>Works closely with 3D artist and animators to create the structure that allows animation of the character or object. More of a technical artist position, but very needed and it is important to have good talent here. Every good rig improves the level of the animations and overall project greatly</p>
      </div>
      <div class="about-col2">

  <!-- 2D -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="row2">
      <h2>2D Art</h2>
      <p>2D art, including concept art I guess, but I am too lazy to make all these into a separate category, so I just lump em all together.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Comic Artist</h3>
      <p>Basically a storyboard artist and a illistrator in one, and without the team, you are the whole team. Just kidding, I guess in big comic company (do those exist?) you would either do the storyboarding or clean up the storyboard and make it into the comic/illistrated finished version.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Sketching</h3>
      <p>This is a category on art station. I dunno if you could speciallize into sketching or whatever but here it is. Probably the unprofessional version of a concept artist</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Pixel Art</h3>
      <p>Super cool 2D art used for 2D flash games, indie games, etc. I have no idea how they get so much detail and personalization out of like one one-millionth of the pixels that the rest of artist use, but power to them. General title for 2d pixel artists, im sure they also subspecialize into environment and character art as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Anime & Manga</h3>
      <p>Similar to comic artists but with a different art style. Used mainly in tv shows, cartoons, and anime comics ie manga. 2D artwork with a very specific style.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Illistration -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Illustration</h3>
      <p>Basically the sexy 2D artist. Unlike the concept artist or storyboard artist who focus on the concept of the piece, the illustrators job is to take the final concept and make it look amazing. These are the book covers, highlight reels, and generally any 2D work you see on art station and the like. As it is the final artwork, the job titles vary quite a bit depending on the industry but ill list a few here; Book Illustrations, Game Art/Cover Art, board and card game art, children's art, editorial illustration, scientific illustration & visualization, and basically any "Concept Art" that is released by companies.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <!-- Architectual Visualization -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h2>Architectual Visualization</h2>
      <p>Mainly a 3D process of turning designs from other concept artists or architects into a 3D viewable scene where clients can get an idea of how the structure will look. Pretty popular and in demand, although not a lot of creative freedom, or dragons, a severe lack of dragons to be honest.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col2">

  <!-- 3D -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="row2">
      <h2>3D Art</h2>
      <p>2D art, including concept art I guess, but I am too lazy to make all these into a separate category, so I just lump em all together.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Environment Artist</h3>
      <p>The 3D environment artist takes care of the world building using 3D tools. Quick summary: Towns and cities, level/level design, open world environments, nature, props (depending on studio).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Character Artist</h3>
      <p>The "Big Cheese". This is probably the most popular 3D artist position out there. Sculpting characters is a lot of fun and having responsibility for the main character in a game or movie is very rewarding, character gets a lot of screen time. Huge focus on form and knowledge of the human body. This is probably one of the hardests positions in 3D, as making a realistic looking human in 3D is very difficult. As we see people all the time, even the smallest detail can make the model look fake. This position is almost always a more senior level position, end game.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Props Artist</h3>
      <p>Generally entry level 3D artist but I'm sure there are senior designers here as well. Depending on the size of the studio might have props under environment artist as well. Generally they create the smaller objects in a scene: crates, barrels, rocks, bottles, etc. props.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Animal Artist</h3>
      <p>Kind of niche, but different enough to be in it's own category. Very similar to character modeling, but obviously the anatomy is way different. If there is a game or movie with the need for very realistic animals, then this position will be needed albeit, a very specific skillset.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Hardsurface Modeling/Artist</h3>
      <p>A 3D artist specializing in hardsurface is the foil of the character artist. They focus on inorganic objects like robots, machines, cars, weapons, armor, guns, etc. Generally these models are very highly detailed and like the character artist, a more senior or high level position.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Costume or Skin Artist</h3>
      <p>I don't really know much about this branch of artist, however with the kinds of games these days, it seems like a lot of need for new skins and costumes. Similarly in film, it might be worthwile to have a dedicated costume artist to create all the looks for a character in 3D. Depending on the size of the studio, this position might fall under character artist, but generally this position will be focused on creating new skins and looks for the character in question. There are some great tools for this, and depending on the company, the duties may include some of all of these: Concepting, 3D modeling, coloring, texturing, etc.</p>
    </div>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Creatures and Monsters</h3>
      <p>The most popular 3D position aside from character artist, are of course, creature or monster artists. There is just something super cool about creating a monster in 3D. Where character artists are limited by the human form, creature artists have a lot more freedom and creative options. This creative freedom is not unlimited however, there still needs to be a lot of knowledge of shape and form to make the creature somewhat believeable. For example, you cant create a huge demon with massive spikes coming out of their shoulders but when he moves his arm he impales himself with them. Certainly a more senior level position that requires much experience in the industry to get into.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Lighting</h3>
      <p>Not sure how common these specialist are, but lighting is exreamely important in the industry, film and games. Lighting can completely change the mood of the scene and is just as important as the modeling or texturing or the music. This could fall under the environment artist to figure out or maybe some of the more senior artists to do at the end of the pipeline. Either way, very important and needed</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>VFX / Motion Graphics</h3>
      <p>Very cool! Visual effects artist bring scenes and actions to life. Some examples include explosions, dust clouds, spell effects, weather effects, etc. I don't really know anything about this branch of art, but it sounds like a very fun one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <img src = "images/Untitled.png">
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Texture Artist</h3>
      <p>The backbone of the 3D industry, the texture artist creates the texture and color that forms all 3D work; from mountains to clothing. Super underrated in my opinion, the texture artist makes all of the 3D artwork beautiful and believeable. Without them, the models look very alien and bleak, the difference a good texture can make vs a bad one is miles. Texture artist use UV maps and a variety of textures and materials to capture the essence of the object and make the object look believable. The level of detail that can be captured is amazing, you can even create depth and shadows within the texture itself making an object like a rock look super realistic without having to sculpt in the detail by hand. As photogrammetry, 3D scanning, and AI continue to improve; the job prospects for these types of artist may dwindle.</p>

  <!-- Merch -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Merch</h3>
      <p>A more buisness focused art path. Similar to architectrual visualization but for mechandise. More precisely focused in Industrial or product design or toys and collectables. Basically created 3D models of concept art for these types of products or all in one artist that does the design and implementation. 3D printing is also very similar and falls into this category.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Tutorials</h3>
      <p>Not really a traditional art path, but there are a lot of people in art who focus on creating tutorals or guides in various ways. Pretty much anything on this page can be the subject of a tutorial channel as well as more focused art advice and skills like form, etc. Teaching could also be listed here as an art path as well.</p>

    <div class="row2">
      <h2>Pure Art</h2>
      <p>"Pure Art" is the term I am going to use for more traditional artist, not necessarily attached to digital art. There are a million but I am just going to list a few categories from artstation here.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Painting</h3>
      <p>Traditional artist to the core, this type of artist is skilled in the use of the paintbrush and easle. I suppose digital painting counts as well? I dont know too much about traditional art so I'm just kind of winging it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Traditional artist focused on making the weird and controversial art, like the weird shapes splattered all over the page that people argue isn't art but others argue is the pure expression of art or whatever. I don't really know anything about it; I aint no artist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Portraits</h3>
      <p>A traditional artist specializing in portraits I guess? I dunno I'm not an artist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">

      <p>Realism.. I dunno I'm not an artist.</p>

  <!-- Technical Artist -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="row2">
      <h2>Technical Artist</h2>
      <p>Last but certainly not least, the technical artist is a branch of art with a more specific technical task attached to it. I will try to cover a few but the list is long and impossible to capture in one place.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Gameplay & Level Design</h3>
      <p>More of a game developer role here, this has very little to do with art and a lot to do with design and understanding of the gaming industry. Create the flow and experience that the player will have while playing the game.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Scripts and Tools</h3>
      <p>This is more of a programmer role here, however the knowledge of the branch of art you will be creating tools for is far more important than the simple programming needed here. To be a good tools artist/programmer, you must understand what the artist need in order to help support them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
      <p>Most common in web development, but also highly needed in the games industry; this type of artist focuses on creating the most intuitive and good looking user interface. This is most likely always a stand alone design position that is fully focused on creating mock ups and designs for whatever project they are working on, similar to a concept artist really, but with a huge focus on user behavior and human computer interaction. The rabbit hole goes deep with this one so I am just going to leave it at that.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
      <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
      <p>Not really sure if this is it's own position or what.. I mean to me, I dont see a real difference from creating something in 3D for a console game vs a VR game, but who knows, they might have to be scaled appropriately or something. Also this might be more of a technical role to port the 3D work into a new VR environment. Not really sure, but it exists.</p>
